# FSB-2022-ID-Retrieval
Federal Government Scholarship Login ID Problem

Problem:
After registering for the FSB Scholarship, the Board accidentally cleared all student profiles, leaving applicants unable to log in and retrieve their application ID. This posed a significant issue as students needed their application ID to check their exam date and venue.

Solution:
To address this problem, I implemented an automated system to retrieve login ID details for students who had applied for the Federal Government Scholarship in 2022.

Approach:
Our solution involved utilizing web scraping and automation techniques using Python to collect and recover all the necessary data.
